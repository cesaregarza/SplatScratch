# SplatScratch

This is purely a scratchpad I use to test out ideas and concepts. It's not meant to be a full-fledged project, but rather a place to test out ideas and concepts. Feel free to use it as a reference, but don't expect it to be a full-fledged project, to have a lot of documentation, or to be bug-free. It's just a scratchpad. Additionally, don't expect explanations whatsoever.

## Installation

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install the dependencies, run `poetry install`. There are no development dependencies as, again, this is just a scratchpad. The selenium scraper requires a webdriver to be installed which is not provided by this project. Personally, I use geckodriver.
